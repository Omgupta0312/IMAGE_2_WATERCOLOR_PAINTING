STEPS INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT:-
* UPLOADING the colored images.
* Resizing the image.
* Removing the impurities from the image by using medianBlur function.
* Preserving the edges and its information while blurring the image.
  (using edgePreservingFilter)
* A bilateral filter is a non-linear, edge-preserving, and noise-reducing
  smoothing filter for images. It replaces the intensity of each pixel with
  a weighted average of intensity values from nearby pixels. This weight 
  can be based on a Gaussian distribution.
* Now to sharp the image we need to use the addWeighted function.
* A water painting of an image in OpenCV has been created.
